Brayden Klemens 2019

## About
The purpose of this project is to implement a simple linux shell both built in commands and external custom commands.

### Built in commands
- The built in commands include all possible commands that are available in linux
- Examples: ls, cd, pwd, ls -1 > foo, sort < inputfile (and so on)

### Custom Commands
- ```exit``` terminates the shell
- ```gcd``` finds the greatest common divisor of either decimal or hexadecimal
- ```b2d``` converts binary to decimal

## Tech Stack
- C Programming language

## Execution
```
cd CShell
make
make run
```
