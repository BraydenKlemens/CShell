To run the Program:

make
./ish

- The program should recognize commands which I implemented before forking the process
- The program then calls the function which runs the commands such as: -gcd, args, other command
- In gcd if anything is hex it converts to numbers
- gcd can only handle the biggest integers
- Args I tried implementing but failed on parsing the input
- b2d converts binary to decimal
